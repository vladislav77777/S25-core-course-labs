# **Terraform**

## âœ… Best Practices

- I **use variables** instead of hardcoded values to make configurations **flexible and reusable**.

```hcl
variable "js_container_name" {
  description = "Name for the JavaScript application container"
  type        = string
  default     = "countdown-timer"
}
```

- Also, separate configurations into different files to maintain clarity and modularity
- Always check for syntax errors and logical mistakes before deploying.

```hcl
\S25-core-course-labs\terraform\docker> terraform validate
Success! The configuration is valid.
```

- Define output values to retrieve important resource information.

## Yandex Cloud

This Terraform configuration sets up a cloud infrastructure on Yandex Cloud, consisting of:

- A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) â€“ to create an isolated network.
- A Subnet â€“ to define IP ranges within the VPC.
- A Persistent Disk â€“ for VM storage with a specified image (Ubuntu).
- A Compute Instance (VM) â€“ a virtual machine with specified CPU, memory, and SSH access.
- Network Configuration â€“ The VM is assigned both internal and external IP addresses with NAT enabled.

### **ðŸ“Œ Command:**

```bash

```

### **ðŸ“‹ Output:**

```bash
vm_external_ip = "84.201.133.40"
vm_id = "fhm7p44s09ksonkmg1n5"
vm_internal_ip = "192.168.0.20"

## GitHub Teams

```css
This Terraform configuration applied changes to the GitHub organization devops-lab-vladislav, including the creation
of a new repository (DevOps-Course), setting up branch protection rules, and defining three teams(Maintainers,
Contributors, and Readers) with different levels of access. The repository is public, initialized with a README,
and has issues tracking enabled. The default branch is main, with mandatory pull request reviews and admin protection.
Teams were assigned appropriate permissions, ensuring structured collaboration and security within the organization.
```

![](img/teams.png)

- Teams (Maintainers, Contributors, Readers) are assigned only the necessary permissions, ensuring secure access
  control.
- The main branch is protected with enforced pull request reviews and admin restrictions to maintain code integrity.
- Variables (github_token, github_organization) keep the configuration flexible, avoiding hardcoded credentials or
  organization details.
- Sensitive data like tokens are stored as environment variables, preventing accidental exposure.
- The repository settings, access controls, and security policies are declaratively managed with Terraform, enabling
  traceable and reproducible changes.
