# Countdown Timer Web Application

## Overview

This web application is a simple countdown timer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to set a custom time, start the countdown, and alerts the user when the timer ends.

## Features

- Set a custom time using minutes and seconds input.
- Displays the countdown in a clean and readable format.
- Alerts when the timer reaches zero.
- Reset functionality to clear the countdown.

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Separation of Concerns:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are separated into individual files for better organization.
2. **Event Listeners:** Used `addEventListener` for handling user interactions.
3. **Code Readability:** Variable names are meaningful, and functions are small and focused on a single task.
4. **Input Validation:** Ensures the timer starts only with valid inputs.

## Local Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `app_js` folder.
3. Open `index.html` in any web browser to use the application.
