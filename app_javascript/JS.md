# Countdown Timer Web Application

## Overview

This web application is a simple countdown timer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to set a custom time, start the countdown, and alerts the user when the timer ends.

## Best Practices

1. **Separation of Concerns:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are separated into individual files for better organization.
2. **Event Listeners:** Used `addEventListener` for handling user interactions.
3. **Code Readability:** Variable names are meaningful, and functions are small and focused on a single task.
4. **Input Validation:** Ensures the timer starts only with valid inputs.
